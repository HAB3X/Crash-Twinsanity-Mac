// The hardware renderer: the GS's primitives drawn by the GPU (OpenGL 3.3 core) into render targets at the internal resolution,
// the way PCSX2's hardware renderers do. Local memory stays the PS2's and the GS front end (registers, kicks, transfers, the
// CLUT, the PCRTC) the same; the renderer keeps a render target for each frame and depth buffer it draws into and keeps them and
// local memory in step page by page. What it can't draw exactly (a frame in a Z format, blends GL's blending can't make, the
// destination alpha test, a texture's region clamp...) is left to the software rasteriser at the PS2's resolution, local memory
// made current for it first.
