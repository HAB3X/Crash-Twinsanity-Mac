// VU1's programs run as C++ translated from the game's microcode at build time (native/tools/vu1_translate.py; native/GRAPHICS.md,
// "VU1 translation"), the interpreter (vu.cpp) running whatever has no translation. The results are the interpreter's, bit for
// bit: TWIN_VU1 chooses
//
//     (unset)      translated
//     interpret    the interpreter alone
//     verify       each program run twice, by the interpreter on a copy and translated, and compared: every XGKICK's packet
//                  (VU1's data memory) and registers, and at the program's end the registers, flags and memory
//
// A program's translation is used where micro memory holds its code (checked whenever the code changes), wherever it was
// uploaded to.
