// The DMA controller's source chain mode, as the renderer's channels use it: tags (CNT, NEXT, REF, REFS, REFE, CALL, RET, END)
// that send quadwords after them or at their address and say where the next tag is, with a two level call stack. VIF1's
// channel sends each tag's second half to the VIF first (TTE), the GIF's channel only the data.
//
// The chains' addresses are the renderer's 32 bit DMA addresses (address.h), turned back into host memory here.
