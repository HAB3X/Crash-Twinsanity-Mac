// The render thread: the GS's side of the hardware (the GIF, the GS's registers and local memory, the hardware renderer and its
// OpenGL context) runs on a thread of its own, a frame behind the game. The game's thread runs the game, VU0, VIF1 and VU1 as
// before; what they send the GIF (VU1's XGKICK packets, VIF1's DIRECT data, the GIF channel's chains) is copied into a queue the
// render thread takes it from in the same order, so the GS gets exactly what it got before. Everything else that touches the GS's
// side (the PCRTC's registers, a movie's picture, the glyph images, the renderer's settings, reading the picture back) goes
// through the same queue as work to run there, in its place among the data.
//
// The frames: Present queues the frame's picture to be made (the shown buffer copied out of its render target), then waits for
// the one before it and shows that in the window on the main thread (SDL's window and swap calls are the main thread's). So the
// game builds frame N + 1 while the render thread draws frame N, and the window shows N - 1 then: one frame later than the game
// made it, as on the PS2, whose DMA sent a frame's chain while the game built the next.
//
// $TWIN_RENDER_THREAD=0 keeps everything on the game's thread (as before the render thread). See native/GRAPHICS.md, "Threads".
