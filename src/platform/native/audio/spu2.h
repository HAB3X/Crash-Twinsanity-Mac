// The SPU2: the PS2's sound processor, emulated at its registers. Two cores of 24 voices playing PS-ADPCM out of 2 MB of memory
// (Native::g_SpuMemory) with the gaussian interpolation, ADSR envelopes, volume sweeps, noise and pitch modulation, a reverb per
// core working in its area of the memory, and each core's input from memory (AutoDMA). Every register is the hardware's: the
// I/O processor's code (libsd) drives it through Read and Write at its addresses (0x1F900000 on), and transfers to and from its
// memory through the I/O processor's DMA channels 4 and 7 (the IOP side calls the Dma functions). Tick makes one 48 kHz
// sample. What it does follows the hardware as PCSX2's SPU2 (pcsx2/SPU2) has it; native/AUDIO.md lists the details
