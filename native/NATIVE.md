# The native build (macOS, Linux)

The game's C++ built for the host (Apple silicon or x86-64 macOS, Linux) instead of the PS2, with a platform layer of its own in
`src/platform/native/`. `TWIN_NATIVE` is defined for it. Every change the native build needs in the shared code is under
`TWIN_NATIVE` or uses a type that is the PS2's own on the PS2 (`uiptr`, `siptr`: PS2SDK's pointer-sized integers, 32 bit there),
so the PS2 build stays the same executable: check it with `tools/build.py` and a comparison with the last PS2 build.

## How the native build differs from the PS2's

The aim is the retail game's behaviour exactly. Where the host can't do what the PS2 did, the difference is listed here: nothing
is approximated without an entry.

| Where | The PS2 | The native build | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Struct layouts | 32 bit pointers, the retail offsets (`CHECK_SIZE`, `CHECK_OFFSET`, `CHECK_LAYOUT`) | 64 bit pointers: structs holding pointers are bigger, the checks are off | None on behaviour; data the game reads from files isn't laid over pointer-holding structs |
| The retail code's null pointer reads and writes (docs/RETAIL_BUGS.md, "Low addresses"; several reached in normal play) | The kernel's RAM is at 0: reads return it, writes change it | `src/platform/native/lowmemory.cpp`: a load or store faulting below 1 MB is decoded (arm64) and done on `g_NativeLowMemory`, then the game goes on. Jumps through null crash as on the PS2. `--selftest-lowmemory` checks it | The values read are zeros unless `build/native/ps2_low_memory.bin` (a dump of the PS2's first MB, from PCSX2) is there. x86-64 hosts don't emulate it yet |
| `AgentLabPacket` slot reads with no data (`include/game/agentlab.h`) | Reads the byte at the slot's index as an address: the kernel's memory | Reads `g_NativeLowMemory` directly | As above |
| `MemoryAllocateAligned` / `FreeHeap` (`src/game/memory.cpp`) | The word in front of an aligned allocation holds the block's address | It holds the distance back to the block | None (the address doesn't fit 32 bits) |
| `CompareHandles` (`src/game/triggernodes.cpp`) | The difference of two addresses | Their order (-1, 0, 1) | None: only the sign is used |
| Objects' frame spread (`ObjectNode`, `GameOGI`: `(address >> 8) & mask`) | The heap address's bits | The host address's low 32 bits | Which frame an object's periodic work falls on differs; how often it happens doesn't |
| Pointers as 32 bit values (`RunAgentEvent`'s originator, collision hit faces, `ResourceIdList::countOrMore`, `CharacterAgent::standingStamp`, the second pad) | `u32` | `uiptr` (64 bit) | None |
| `CopyQuadword` (`src/game/eventcallers.cpp`) | LQ/SQ, the addresses' low 4 bits dropped | A 16 byte copy at the addresses with their low 4 bits dropped | None |
| Small allocations (`SmallAllocate`, `src/game/memory.cpp`) | Sizes rounded up to 4 bytes: entries of 4, 8, 12... | Rounded up to 8: a free entry holds a 64 bit link | Which size class an allocation lands in; nothing the game sees |
| Objects allocated by a fixed size (`GameChunkManagerSize`, `ObjectPlaceSize`, `ProjectileNodeSize`, the shadows' model and mesh, `UnusedBlockSize`) | Their PS2 size | `NativeObjectBytes`: twice it (only pointers grow, so nothing can need more) | More memory used |
| The pools' space (`Platform::Memory::PoolSpace`) | 32 MB less the executable and the C library's reserve (~28 MB) | Four times that (twice ran out loading a level) | The game's heap runs out later than on the PS2 |
| The C library's `malloc`/`free` (`RetailLibc::Malloc`) | Sony's dlmalloc on sbrk | The host's (16 byte aligned) | None: the game's own heap manager works inside its pools as on the PS2 |
| The console's language | The PS2's OSD setting | The machine's preferred languages (the first the game has, else English) | The language the game starts in follows the computer |
| Two `u32` globals splat ended in a pad (`G_DynamicSceneryClockIndex`, `G_SizeOfByteArrayAt_0x3D3F28_0x18`) | Unreferenced bytes followed them | The bytes after them aren't brought over | None: nothing reads past a single `u32` |
| `ProjectileObjectNode` (`src/game/projectiles.cpp`) | Its members overlay the node base's runners, frame start and frame move (the shooting commands write its state through `frameMove`) | The base's part is whole and the projectile's members follow it; the commands find them through `NativeProjectileState` | None seen: the prototype's `Reset` wrote the overlaid fields before `Construct` set them all |
| `PickupObjectNode` (`include/game/pickups.h`), and the stand-in's `PickupNodeTimes` (`src/game/instancefactory.cpp`) | Its members (bits, trails, body, spin phase, velocity, wait start) overlay the node base's runners, frame start and frame move | The base's part is whole and the pickup's members follow it, as the projectile's; the stand-in writes the wait start through the pickup's own class | None seen: the prototype's construction wrote the overlaid fields before `Initialise` set them. With the base's part at the PS2's size natively, those writes landed on the spin phase and the beach crashed reading its spin matrix |
| `g_SaveBuffer` (`src/game/savemanager.cpp`) | A bank file's 0xF400 bytes are read and written from `D_0030BF28`, whose own label is 0x1948 bytes: the save runs over the BSS after it (`D_0030D870` and on, other code's scratch) | A buffer of the bank's size of its own | The native data doesn't put that BSS behind it: saving ran over the heap manager and crashed |
| `GameContext::instanceFactory` | 0x28 bytes for the factory made in place | `NativeObjectBytes` of it | None |
| Saves | Memory cards in two ports (libmc), checked at boot and polled while autosave is on | The game's own save manager (`src/platform/ps2/saves.cpp`) on `src/platform/native/memorycard.cpp`: port 1's card always in and formatted (8 MB), its files a folder in the app's settings (`~/Library/Application Support/Crash Twinsanity/memorycard`), port 2 empty; formatting never wipes it. The flow is a computer's, after the Xbox version's console-storage one (native/XBOX_SAVES.md, section 3), under `TWIN_NATIVE` in the game's code: no check at boot (`gamecontroller.cpp`, N1), no polling while autosave is on (N2), "not enough space" is the NoRoom screen (N4, N5: also when the save can't be made), back/cancel ends a save at once with no "cancel save?" (N6); and, the native build's own: no "create a save file?" question (a save is made at once and the slots shown), NoRoom offers "continue without saving" (new game) / "cancel" / "retry" (retry measures again), a load from a save with no game in its slots says "no save data". Kept from the PS2 on purpose: retry after a failed save measures again (the Xbox's made the save afresh, wiping the other slots, N11), the 2 s each message stays (the Xbox's 3 s is its certification rule), the save's layout (N14), no Dashboard item (N10), the size in KB. Every message is the PC's wording (native/PC_TEXT.md). `--selftest-saves` checks a save's round trip, `--selftest-ui` the flow's changes on the game's save code | The card can't be pulled out; no screen mentions a card |
| The console's texts | The language files' lines about the PlayStation 2, its memory cards, slots, controller ports and DUALSHOCK 2 | Those lines (140: 28 in each of the five languages) replaced with a computer's wording when the game splits a text file into lines (`ReadTextFile`, `src/platform/native/ui/pctext.cpp`); every original and replacement is in native/PC_TEXT.md. `--selftest-ui` checks them against the disc, `--dump-texts` prints every line as the native build has them | The texts say "computer", "controller", "save data" |
| The graphic options | Centre screen, widescreen | Also "resolution" (the render scale, 1x to 4x the PS2's picture) and "display" (a window of 960x720, 1280x960, 1600x1200, 1920x1440, 1280x720 or 1920x1080, or fullscreen at the display's size; the picture keeps the TV's shape, letterboxed). 3x and 4x say "slow" (the software rasteriser: about 5 times 1x's drawing time at 2x, 13 at 4x): the game's own choice items, their texts past the code file's lines (0x100 on, native/PC_TEXT.md). A choice is applied as it's made (`NativeGraphicsSetResolution`, `graphics/resolution.h`) and kept in the app's settings (`resolution.txt`), applied again at start-up (`src/main.cpp`; not with `--headless`, so tests keep the 1x picture). `src/platform/native/ui/resolution.cpp` | More items on the page |
| The disc | The PS2's drive (fileio, MultiStream on the I/O processor) | The ISO image read in place (`--iso`, `$TWINSANITY_ISO` or local.json's `disc_image`); streamed reads finish when asked for | None on what's read; reads never wait |

The build also generates weak stand-ins (`native/tools/make_stubs.py`) for every function nothing defines yet: each logs "not implemented yet" the first time it's called (`--quiet-stubs` hides them) and returns 0. A real definition replaces one at link time. Stand-ins are scaffolding, not behaviour: the log is the list of what's left.

Floating point: the R5900's FPU isn't IEEE (no infinities or denormals, results rounded towards zero) and VU0's results are its
own. The native build uses the host's IEEE floats for now; where the decomp keeps VU0's exact results (`Platform::Math`) the
native side has to reproduce them.

## Controls (keyboard and mouse)

The defaults (`src/platform/native/ui/bindings.cpp`, `Infos`; rebound on the options' Controls tab, kept in `bindings.txt`):

| Action | The PS2's | Key | Alt key | Controller |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Move | Left stick | W A S D (full deflection; a diagonal 1/&radic;2 on each axis, as a stick's) | - | Left stick (fixed) |
| Look and camera | Right stick | The mouse's movement (mouse look), and the arrows | - | Right stick (fixed) |
| Jump | Cross | Space | - | South (A / cross) |
| Spin | Square | Left mouse button | J | West (X / square) |
| Crouch, skid, slide | Circle | Left Shift | K | East (B / circle) |
| Status (HUD) | Triangle | Tab | I | North (Y / triangle) |
| Shoulder left / right | L1 and L2 / R1 and R2 | Q / E | - | LB and LT / RB and RT |
| Pause | Start | Esc | Enter | Start |

- Any of the mouse's buttons (left, right, middle, 4, 5) and the wheel's turns up and down can be bound to a key cell (a turn holds
  its key for one of the pad's reads). The mouse's buttons are keys only in play: in the menus the left button picks and the
  right goes back. A binding taken by another action swaps with it. A `bindings.txt` from before this scheme (no `version=2`)
  keeps its pad buttons and takes the new keys.
- Mouse look (`src/platform/native/ui/mouselook.cpp`; the Controls tab's "Mouse look", on by default, "Mouse sensitivity" 1-10,
  default 5, and "Invert mouse Y", off). It applies only while the game is played: GameController's `StatePlaying`, the game
  running (not paused), no cutscene letterbox showing, the options shut and the window in front. Then the window holds the mouse
  in SDL's relative mode with the cursor hidden; it lets go in the pause and game menus, the options, cutscenes and movies, and
  when the window loses the focus, so the menus' cursor works. Each of the pad's reads turns the motion since the last read into
  the right stick: the speed (points a second) over the full-deflection speed (2400 / sensitivity: 480 points a second at 5), at
  least 0.2 once the mouse moves (the game's own dead zone swallows less), and 1 for a flick. With no motion an axis falls back to
  the middle within 50 ms, so it never drifts. A gamepad's right stick and the mouse are both read and the larger deflection on
  each axis wins; the arrows override both. The camera's invert X applies to the mouse too.
- Prompts: with the keyboard in use, a key on a mouse button shows as a keycap with the mouse drawn on it and that button lit
  (`mouseart.cpp`): the options' footer and descriptions, the Controls table (the mouse beside its name), and the game's own hints
  (their glyph drawn as the mouse through `NativeGraphicsSetGlyphImage`, as the Xbox's art is).
- `--selftest-ui` checks the defaults, WASD's diagonal, the mouse keys' names, mouse look's push (a flick saturates, a slow move
  pushes a little, back to the middle with no motion, Y inverted) and the skip below.

Cutscenes and movies: "hold any button to skip" (the cutscene skip option, `OptionSkipCutscenes`, is the master switch;
`ui/features.cpp`). Any key, mouse button or pad button (the triggers too) held 0.6 s, timed rather than counted in frames,
skips. It counts only if pressed after the scene began: what was held as it began (running or jumping into it) is ignored until
it's let go. A scene is the run of polls from the skip condition (572, `NoOpCutsceneSkippedCondition`) or a movie's frames
(`MovieSkipHeld`); a 0.25 s gap starts the next. The skip is reported for 0.15 s, then whatever is still held is ignored again,
so the scene after isn't skipped too. The prompt is the game's own letterbox text (the AgentLab texts' line 0x18, "hold any
button to skip" in the five languages; the level recipes show it, "Bug fixes (optional)" below). While a button is held, the
overlay draws a bar under it that fills over the 0.6 s. The game's own skippable scenes (a Triangle rule,
`IsTrianglePressedCondition`) still answer triangle as on the PS2.

## Native bugs found by the level sweep

The level sweep (native/LEVEL_SWEEP.md, `native/tools/level_sweep.py`) starts every level chunk headless and plays it. What it
found that the native build does differently from the PS2, and the fixes:

| Bug | Why | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VU0 programs called with another set loaded (77 of the first 86 chunks aborted while loading: "another microcode set's code is loaded at the microprogram 0xAB8") | The chunks' loading (`BackgroundWork`, after the frame's draw left VU0's culling set loaded) makes the chunk's instances; a character's follow camera restarts and casts its view (`FollowCameraRig::Restart`, `CastView`), whose collision test calls the standard set's ray-triangle microprogram (0xAB8). On the PS2 VU0 then runs the culling set's code at those addresses and the test returns whatever that gives (a retail quirk: only the camera's first placement reads it) | `Vu0CallMicroprogram` (`math/vu0.cpp`) runs the translated program the call means (the right test) and says so once a program, instead of aborting |
| Loading a save from the main menu crashed (SIGSEGV at pc 0 in `StateBody::Destroy`) | Loading the level unloads the title's chunk (the beach), destroying its scripts; condition 95's (`HeadYawAboveLimitCondition`) vtable is split across two labels in the retail data (`vt_Cond95_Unknown` holds its first entry, `D_00300030` the rest), so the native data took one entry and its destructor slot read past it (null). Any chunk unload that destroys a condition 95 crashed the same way | `include/game/conditions.h`: the vtable declared with its 5 entries, so the data converter takes in the label after it (the PS2 build unchanged). A scan of `.rodata` finds no other vtable split this way. Checked with `$TWIN_SAVE_TEST`: save from the pause menu, then load from the main menu and play |
| Texture packs switched on in the options could crash the renderer | `ReplacementsSetEnabled` (game thread) rescanned the pack, clearing the maps the hardware renderer's `FindReplacement` (presenter thread) reads and whose images it holds pointers to | `graphics/hw/replace.cpp`: the pack scanned once (the first time it's on) and never freed, the switch an atomic, the maps under a lock |

## Building and running

    native/tools/build_ffmpeg.sh
    cmake -S native -B build/native/cmake -G Ninja && cmake --build build/native/cmake
    "build/native/cmake/Crash Twinsanity" --iso "/path/to/Crash Twinsanity (Europe).iso"

`build_ffmpeg.sh` builds the movies' FFmpeg (libavcodec and libavutil, the MPEG-2 decoder only, LGPL 2.1) into
`build/native/ffmpeg/<os>-<arch>` from FFmpeg's checked source release; CMake links it (`-DTWIN_FFMPEG_DIR` picks another), else
the system's with a warning, since Homebrew's is GPL 3 and an app carrying it can't be shared under the LGPL. The libraries are
linked dynamically, so whoever has the app can swap them for their own build, which is what the LGPL's relinking clause asks:
`native/tools/bundle_app.py` puts them in `Contents/Frameworks` with their README and licence in
`Contents/Resources/licenses/ffmpeg`, and native/third_party/ffmpeg/README.md says how to replace them.

Full debug info (`-g`) makes Apple clang 21 drop the asm labels of explicit specializations' members: the build uses line tables.
Watch for `(address + A - 1) & ~(A - 1)` with a 32 bit `A`: its mask clears an address's top half (use `~static_cast<uiptr>(A - 1)`).

## Tools

- `native/tools/find_narrow_pointer_casts.py`: every place a 32 bit integer is made a pointer (clang doesn't warn about
  `reinterpret_cast<T*>(u32)`), from clang's AST. Run it after pulling upstream changes: it should print nothing.
- `native/tools/datastats.py`: the data the native build brings over from the split (`asm/data/`), by section.

## Bug fixes (optional)

The "bug fixes" toggle on the settings' Gameplay tab (`OptionRetailFixes`, off by default) turns on fixes of retail bugs, in the
game's code under `TWIN_NATIVE` and asked for through `NativeFixes::RetailFixes()` (`src/platform/native/fixes.h`). With it off
the game is retail's. Each fix comes from the community mod
[Crash-Twinsanity-Improved](https://github.com/AlexMollard/Crash-Twinsanity-Improved) (its wiki's "What the mod changes", its
`mod/elf_patches.txt`, `mod/levels/*.ops` and PCSX2 patches) or from docs/RETAIL_BUGS.md where the intended behaviour is evident.
Level data is changed only in memory, on what's read from the player's disc. `$TWIN_RETAIL_FIXES=0|1` overrides the option and
`$TWIN_FIXES_TEST=NAME` runs a check in the game (with `--headless --quick`, `src/platform/native/fixestest.cpp`); the checks
pass for either setting of the option (fixed with it on, retail's result with it off). `$TWIN_FIXES_TRACE` logs the scripts the
recipes edit.

| Fix | The bug | Source | Code | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aku Aku's invincibility survives explosions | The damage handler lets through any hit of 50 or more while invincible; TNT, Nitro and bombs deal 100, so three masks (or the 2 s after a hit) didn't save Crash from them | The mod's "Aku Aku invincibility" (`elf_patches.txt`, 0x137590-0x137604) | `CharacterAgent::Contact` (`characterstate.cpp`): invincibility also keeps out hits of kind `HitExplosion`; other big hits (instant deaths) still go through | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=aku`: an invincible Crash hit by a 100-damage explosion keeps his 2 hit points with the fix, dies without it; a generic 100 hit kills either way |
| No invisible Crash after a cutscene | A cutscene taking or giving back the player resets the hurt blink's state machine without ending it: one time in five the character stays hidden (and invincible) through the scene and after | The mod's "Invisible Crash after a cutscene" (stub at 0x116EE0 on the store at 0x131844) | `CharacterAgent::Reset`: a running (previous mode invincible) or requested (mode invincible) blink is ended first: visible, the part's `invulnerable` off | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=reset`: a hidden, blinking Crash is visible and not invincible after the reset with the fix, hidden and invincible without |
| Shadows on crates | The characters' shadow only darkens materials whose shader has the settings' byte 24 (the decomp's `noFba`); most crate materials don't have it, so Crash's shadow never fell on a crate | The mod's "Shadows on crates" (wiki engine/graphics; `tools/materials.py`) | `MaterialSectionReaderRead` (`graphicstables.cpp`) hands the material item's bytes to `NativeFixes::MaterialRead`: every opaque shader (blending 0) of a material named `CRATE_`, `CRATES_`, `AKUCRATE_`, `AKUCRATES_` or `life_crate` gets byte 24 set, as the mod's tool (a material that doesn't read to its end exactly is left alone) | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=recipes` counts them on the disc: 580 shaders in 89 levels, the mod's build's own count. Applied when a level loads (a change of the option shows at the next load). Not checked on screen |
| A beaten boss stays beaten | The beaten Tiki Mon (Totem Hokum) keeps its contact damage: walking into the wreck costs a mask, or a life and the fight again | The mod's `mod/levels/harmless_after_defeat.ops` | The level recipes (below): `appendcmds 4015 8 0 1511 7 0`, COM_EARTH_WORM_START's lone `SetAgent(64)` appended to COM_TIKI_MON_ACTIVATED's last state | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=recipes`: the op made on hubd.rm2's script (634 bytes to 642: one command of one argument), the copied commands the same in the four levels that have script 1511. Not played to the boss |
| WalkController::AskTurn | In the 45-135 degree band the turn is eased by `abs(wanted - 45)/90` for both signs, so turning one way is eased 0.5-1 and the other 1-1.5 | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached: walking) | `characterwalk.cpp`: the share is taken of the turn's size | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=units`: a 90 degree stick turn gives 614400 and -1024000 retail, 614400 and -614400 fixed |
| CharacterAgent::KeepPushedBody | The 4-unit reach is tested on the way to the body after it's made unit long, so a pushed body is kept at any distance ahead | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached) | `charactermovement.cpp`: the length taken before | Code review: the test now sees the distance |
| HumiliskateVehicle::TouchesHull | The contact point is scaled by -rx, -ry and -rz in turn, every component by all three radii | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached: Humiliskate) | `humiliskate.cpp`: each component by its own radius | Code review |
| LaySkidMark | The near end's depth is tested twice, the far end never, so strips are laid with their far end deep under the surface | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached: Humiliskate, Rollerbrawl) | `skidmarks.cpp`: the far end tested too | Code review |
| Cond141-146 (the axis distances) | They measure from the instance to the point of its axis nearest the target: the distance along the axis, not off it (the "horizontal distance" ones give the vertical) | RETAIL_BUGS.md (P, reached: 145 three uses, 146 five) | `conditionchecks.cpp` `DistanceAlongAxisSquared`: from the target to that point | Code review |
| RollerbrawlYaw | Past 50 u/s the ball's speed is replaced by the most yaw speed in radians (3.49), so the camera swings at ~37 deg/s instead of ~200 when fastest | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached: Rollerbrawl) | `followrig.cpp`: the speed kept at 50 | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=units`: the yaw speed at 100 u/s is 6774 retail, 36408 (the 50 u/s one) fixed |
| MoveAim (Cmd591), aim "both" | `(second - first) * 0.5`: half the offset, not the point between | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached: 19 of 388 uses) | `commandscamera.cpp`: `(first + second) * 0.5` | Code review |
| ReleaseInstanceTrack | The track's values (0x14 bytes and a heap header) are nulled without being freed: every cutscene leaks them per instance track | RETAIL_BUGS.md (C, reached) | `videocontroller.cpp`: freed first | Code review |

The cutscene skip's own option (`OptionSkipCutscenes`, on by default) also makes the mod's level recipes that restore the
skips the retail game cut, with its prompt:

| Change | Source | Code | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| The 16 scenes whose skip needed their level's scripts rebuilt (Aku Aku crate, beach training, angry skunk, Rooftop Rampage in both its levels, the Academy hub, the treasure room, Slip Slide Icecapades, Iceberg Lab, Classroom Chaos, the core intro, Madame Amberly's bell tower, both Psychetron room scenes, the dorm room, the walrus chase, Rockslide Rumble) | The mod's `mod/levels/*.ops` | `src/platform/native/levelrecipes.cpp` with the mod's recipe files verbatim (`levelrecipes.inc`): `LoadScript` hands each graph's bytes to `NativeFixes::ScriptRead`, which takes them apart as the mod's `twinsdump edit` does, makes the ops (`addbody`, `copybody`, `clearbodies`, `appendcmds`, `delcmd`, `movebody`, `settarget`, `setarg`) in the recipes' order, and has the game read the result into the same graph. A script whose ops copy from one read after it (the walrus chase, Classroom Chaos) is edited once that one is read; a script that doesn't fit an op is left as the disc has it (logged) | `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=recipes`: every one of the disc's 20,559 scripts (135 levels) taken apart and put back byte for byte; every recipe made on its level (0 failures). In the game, the beach's five are edited as it loads (`TWIN_FIXES_TRACE`). Not played through |
| "Hold any button to skip" in the letterbox while a scene can be skipped (the mod's "hold triangle to skip", made any button: "Controls (keyboard and mouse)" above) | The mod's `skip_prompt.ops` and `mod/text.txt` | The same: `BottomTextDisplay` of the AgentLab texts' line 0x18 on every jump into a state that plays a cutscene and has a Triangle rule, `BottomTextClear` on the jumps out (`skipprompt auto`, made for every script read rather than for the mod's list of levels; the self-test finds that this adds it only to COM_CORTEX_DOCAMOK_EARTH_PHASE2 in 38 more levels, a scene that plays in Doc Amok's alone), plus the mod's seven named ones; line 0x18 (the unused "zzz") is "hold any button to skip" in each language (`pctext.cpp`, native/PC_TEXT.md) | `--selftest-ui` (the line matches the disc, the font has the characters); the self-test above; `TWIN_FIXES_TEST=prompt` with `--snapshots` shows a letterbox with the recipes' command (then "HOLD I TO SKIP": the line named triangle's glyph before it said any button) |

The 21:9 option (`OptionUltrawide`, "ultrawide" in options.txt, off): with the game's widescreen on, the widescreen picture is
21:9, TechieSaru's fix in the mod's PCSX2 patches ([Widescreen 21:9 Ultrawide]): 0x40155554 (2.333) in place of 16:9's
0x3FE38E39 where the renderer loads it (the view's projection in `SetRendererView` and `DrawRendererScene`, the 2D's squeeze in
`FitPlaceToScreen`/`FitSizeToScreen`, `renderer.cpp`), and every movie pillarboxed to the middle three quarters (the patch's nop at
0x2AF408, `MoviePlayer::Draw`). Checked with `--snapshots`: the beach's opening shows a wider view squeezed into the same picture.
The option is the Display tab's "Widescreen" choice 21:9 (4:3, 16:9, 21:9; 21:9 is widescreen on and `OptionUltrawide`); the presenter (`ViewRect`, `graphics/display.cpp`) still shapes the picture 16:9:
`NativeFixes::Ultrawide()` tells both.

Already in the port before these: the skip itself (condition 572, now any button held), movies answering it too, the faster loading
and 60 Hz (their own options), widescreen at start-up, and movies at their own rate (the native player paces them by their
sequence header, not by vertical blanks).

Not done, and why:

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| JumpController::Rise (the knee drop's wait for room) | Where the wait should end isn't evident: the bit is never cleared anywhere else, so keeping it makes the rise retry the knee drop every frame and never reach its fall while there's no room |
| JumpController FallFrame (the per-kind falling gravities) | P: the per-kind gravities never lasted more than a frame, so every fall in the game was tuned on property 1; applying them changes every jump's arc |
| WalkIntoBody (the sphere's sideways push) | The push's size is never computed (it adds `f20 = 0` times nothing): what it should be isn't known |
| OverlappingRangesSpan, StepMovement, CollideRigidBodies | No visible effect known (collision cells, sleeping bodies) or a change to every rigid body's response the game was tuned with |
| The save checksum | Fixing it changes the save format: saves made each way wouldn't load in the other |
| String growth, DiskSizeClass, FindMinimum | No visible effect (heap churn, a size class, convergence speed) |
| The P entries (PoseJoint's squash, Solve's crush test, MakePhysicsBody, ClipSegmentToPlanes, UpdateCutsceneVolumes) and the latent, unreached and dead ones | Possibly intended, or nothing in the game's data reaches them |
| Party arena skip, totem falling skip | Not shipped by the mod (work in progress, and left unskippable on purpose) |

Unconditionally (`TWIN_NATIVE`, not the option): where retail reads memory it never set, the native build gives a defined value,
as the native stack and heap leftovers aren't the PS2's (and one read was out of bounds):

| Where | Retail | Natively |
|---|---|---|
| `PlayCameraTrackFrame` (`cutscenetracks.cpp`) | At the end frame (a skipped cutscene) the cuts are read 0xFFFF frames past their data; a value above 0 there drops the end's values | No cut read at the end frame: the end's values are played |
| `LookController::Construct` (`characterlook.cpp`) | `restSeconds` as the heap had it | 0 |
| `ConstructSkidMarks` (`skidmarks.cpp`) | The last point and the strip's two colours as the heap had them | 0 |
| Cmd48 DropAttachedObject, the attachments' launch (`commandsattach.cpp`, `attachments.cpp`) | A velocity of the stack's leftovers | None |
| Particle trail kind 5 (`particletrails.cpp`) | Compares a vector it never sets | None |
